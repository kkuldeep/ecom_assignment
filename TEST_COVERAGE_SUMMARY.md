- **Edge Case Handling**: Empty files, invalid data types, large datasets

### Task 2: Enriched Tables Testing  
**Focus**: Customer and Product analytics with segmentation
- **Customer Segmentation**: High-value customer identification, repeat customer detection
- **Product Performance**: Best-seller classification, profit margin analysis
- **Enrichment Quality**: Calculation accuracy, metric consistency, data completeness

### Task 3: Enriched Orders Testing
**Focus**: Order enrichment with precise business calculations
- **Join Accuracy**: Customer and product information joining validation
- **Profit Rounding**: Two decimal places precision across all calculations
- **Business Logic**: Order date formatting, quantity validation, sales-profit relationships

### Task 4: Profit Aggregations Testing
**Focus**: Multi-dimensional profit aggregations for reporting
- **Aggregation Accuracy**: Sum consistency, count accuracy, average calculations
- **Dimensional Completeness**: Year, category, customer, and sub-category coverage
- **Business Rules**: Profit rounding, temporal accuracy, hierarchical relationships

### Task 5: SQL Analysis Testing
**Focus**: SQL-based analytics for business intelligence
- **Query Execution**: Syntax accuracy, result structure, performance testing
- **Analytical Functions**: Window functions, aggregations, date functions
- **Business Intelligence**: Executive metrics, trend analysis, cross-dimensional analysis

## How to Run Tests

### Using run_tests.py (Recommended)
The simplest way to run the complete test suite:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

This script will:
- Execute all 33 test methods across 5 test files
- Provide detailed output with colored results
- Show summary of passed/failed tests
- Complete within 5 minutes with timeout protection

### Using pytest directly
For more control over test execution:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_task1_raw_tables.py -v

# Run with detailed output
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=long --color=yes

# Run specific test method
python -m pytest tests/test_task1_raw_tables.py::test_csv_products_loading -v
```

### Test Output Interpretation
- **PASSED**: Test completed successfully, all validations passed
- **FAILED**: Test failed, check error message for details
- **ERROR**: Test couldn't run due to setup issues or import problems

## TDD Approach Benefits

### Development Process
- **Early Bug Detection**: Issues caught before reaching production
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Changes can be made safely with test validation
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of business requirements
- **Development Speed**: TDD reduces debugging time by catching issues early

### Business Value
- **Data Accuracy Guarantee**: Business decisions based on validated, accurate data
- **Compliance Ready**: Data quality standards documented and verified
- **Scalability Assurance**: Pipeline tested to handle business growth
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing reduces data pipeline failures

### Operations
- **Automated Validation**: Tests can run automatically in CI/CD pipelines
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance benchmarks
- **Error Prevention**: Issues caught before affecting business operations
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Changes validated quickly and thoroughly

## Test Environment Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ with PySpark installed
- pytest testing framework
- Sample data files: Customer.xlsx, Orders.json, Products.csv
- Source code modules: src/processing.py, src/config.py

### Environment Validation
Run this to check your environment:
```bash
python -c "import pytest, pyspark; print('Environment ready for testing')"
```

## Test File Structure

```
tests/
├── conftest.py                     # Test configuration and fixtures
├── test_task1_raw_tables.py        # Raw data ingestion tests (5 methods)
├── test_task2_enriched_tables.py   # Customer & product analytics tests (6 methods)  
├── test_task3_enriched_orders.py   # Order enrichment tests (7 methods)
├── test_task4_profit_aggregations.py # Aggregation tests (7 methods)
└── test_task5_sql_analysis.py      # SQL analytics tests (8 methods)
```

Each test file focuses on a specific aspect of the data pipeline and includes comprehensive validation of business logic, data quality, and performance characteristics.
